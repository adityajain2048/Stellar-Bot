export const privateKeyMessage = `Important Notice Before Exporting Your Key

Your wallet operates on a smart contract, making it a "Smart Account Wallet." When you choose to export your key, what you're actually receiving is the key to your Vault address, not the smart account itself.

What's a Vault?

A Vault is your personal storage on the blockchain, controlled by an External Owned Account (EOA).
It's separate from your smart account but can securely hold all your assets.
What Happens If You Export?
Exporting your key:

Transfers all assets from your smart account to your Vault (EOA).
Grants you the private key to the Vault for full control over these assets.
Would you like to proceed and export your wallet key, transferring your assets to the Vault?`;
